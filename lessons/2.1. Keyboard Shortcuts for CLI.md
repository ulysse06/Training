# CLI Standard Keyboard Shortcuts

One of the great features of the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is the availability of several powerful keyboard shortcuts that can help you navigate and interact with the system more efficiently. These shortcuts are particularly useful for speeding up your workflow and avoiding repetitive typing. Below are some of the most commonly used CLI keyboard shortcuts:

### 1. **History Navigation**
Linux allows you to quickly access previous commands, saving you time if you need to repeat or modify a command you've already used. These are especially handy when you're working with long or complex commands.

- **Up Arrow** (`↑`): Pressing the up arrow key will bring up the previous command entered.
- **Down Arrow** (`↓`): Pressing the down arrow key will bring up the next command in the history list (if you’ve navigated up using the up arrow).
- **Ctrl + R**: This initiates a reverse search. Pressing `Ctrl + R` and typing a portion of a previous command allows you to search through your command history to find matching commands. Keep pressing `Ctrl + R` to cycle through previous matches.
- **history**: Typing the `history` command will display a list of the most recent commands you have entered, complete with their command numbers.
- **!number**: To repeat a specific command from the history, use `!` followed by the command number (e.g., `!25` to execute the 25th command in your history).
- **!!**: This will repeat the last command entered. It's a quick way to re-run the previous command, often useful after you've made minor changes to it.

### 2. **Autocompletion**
Autocompletion is a useful feature that automatically fills in file names, command names, and other arguments, reducing typing time and minimizing errors. You can use it as follows:

- **Tab**: Pressing the `Tab` key will attempt to autocomplete a command, file, or directory name. For example, if you type `cd Doc` and press `Tab`, it may automatically complete it to `cd Documents`, assuming there is a folder named "Documents" in your current directory.
- **Double Tab** (`Tab` + `Tab`): If there are multiple possible completions, pressing `Tab` twice will list the available options. For instance, typing `ls /u` and then pressing `Tab` twice will show all directories starting with "u" (like `usr` or `ubuntu`).
- **Tab Autocomplete for Command Options**: Autocompletion also works for command options. If you're typing a command like `git` and press `Tab`, it will suggest available subcommands or options, making it easier to remember the syntax.

### 3. **Text Navigation and Editing**
These shortcuts allow you to quickly move through and edit the command line, without having to use the mouse or retype everything.

- **Ctrl + A**: Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl + E**: Move the cursor to the end of the line.
- **Ctrl + U**: Cut everything from the cursor position to the beginning of the line.
- **Ctrl + K**: Cut everything from the cursor position to the end of the line.
- **Ctrl + W**: Cut the word before the cursor position.
- **Ctrl + Y**: Paste the last cut text (using `Ctrl + U`, `Ctrl + K`, or `Ctrl + W`).
- **Ctrl + D**: Delete the character under the cursor. (If you're at the beginning of a line, this can close the terminal.)
- **Ctrl + H**: Delete the character before the cursor (similar to the Backspace key).
- **Ctrl + L**: Clear the screen, similar to typing `clear` or `cls`.

### 4. **Process Control**
If you’re running long processes in the terminal, you can use the following shortcuts to control them without closing the terminal.

- **Ctrl + C**: Sends a `SIGINT` (interrupt) signal to the current running process, which generally stops it.
- **Ctrl + Z**: Sends a `SIGTSTP` (stop) signal to the current running process, temporarily suspending it. You can resume it later.
- **bg**: If you've suspended a process with `Ctrl + Z`, you can run it in the background by typing `bg`.
- **fg**: Brings a background job back to the foreground.

### 5. **Terminal Control**
These shortcuts help control the terminal session itself.

- **Ctrl + Shift + T**: Open a new tab in the terminal (if your terminal supports tabs).
- **Ctrl + C**: Close the terminal session (this is equivalent to typing `exit`).
- **Ctrl + D**: Another way to close the terminal or end a session (also equivalent to `exit`).

### 6. **Cut, Copy, and Paste**
While most Linux terminals allow you to use the mouse for copying and pasting, you can also use keyboard shortcuts.

- **Ctrl + Shift + C**: Copy the selected text in the terminal.
- **Ctrl + Shift + V**: Paste the copied text into the terminal.
  
By using these keyboard shortcuts, you can navigate, edit, and manage your work in the terminal much more efficiently. As you become more familiar with them, you’ll be able to perform tasks faster, without the need to constantly type everything out or rely on the mouse.
