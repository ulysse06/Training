# Introduction to Linux-based Command Line Interface (CLI)

Welcome to the world of Linux-based systems! In this document, we'll be briefly introducing you to the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, a powerful way to interact with your computer. We'll cover the basics to get you started.

## What is the Command Line Interface (CLI)?

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Unlike Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where you point and click with a mouse, the CLI relies on typing specific commands to execute tasks.

In Linux, the CLI is often referred to as the **Terminal** or **Shell**. It is a very efficient way of managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings, especially for advanced users.

## Why Use the CLI?

1. **Efficiency**: Many tasks can be performed faster with the CLI than with a GUI.
2. **Powerful Commands**: The CLI provides access to many powerful tools and options that are not available in the GUI.
3. **Automation**: You can create scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
4. **Resource-friendly**: The CLI uses less system resources than GUIs, making it useful for remote management of servers or on systems with limited resources.

## Common Components of the CLI

### 1. **Terminal**

The Terminal is the window where you type and see the output of commands.

### 2. **Shell**

The **Shell** is the program that processes your commands and returns results.

### 3. **Prompt**

The **Command Prompt** (or simply "prompt") is where you type your commands. It typically shows information like the username and the system you're using.

Example prompt:

```bash
username@hostname:~$
```

## Accessing the CLI on Different Operating Systems

### 1. **Linux (Native CLI)**

Linux systems come with a built-in terminal or console for accessing the command line. The terminal is usually installed by default and can be accessed easily.

- **Open Terminal**: 
  - On most Linux distributions (like Ubuntu), you can open the terminal by searching for "Terminal" in the application menu or by using the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
  
  Once open, you’ll see the shell prompt where you can start typing commands. The default shell on most distributions is **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell).

### 2. **MacOS (Native CLI)**

MacOS also provides a terminal application for accessing the command line.

- **Open Terminal**:
  - You can access the terminal by opening the **Spotlight search** (press `Cmd + Space`) and typing "Terminal."
  - Alternatively, navigate to **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**.
  
  Once the terminal is open, you’ll be using the **Bash** shell or **Zsh** (depending on the macOS version).

### 3. **Windows (Using WSL)**

If you're using Windows, you'll need to enable **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** to run a Linux distribution in a terminal. We recommend using **Ubuntu** as your Linux distribution for compatibility and ease of use.

#### Setting Up WSL on Windows

To get started with WSL and set up **Ubuntu**, follow the official Microsoft guide for installing WSL:

- [Install WSL on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

The basic process involves:
1. **Enabling WSL** via Windows Features.
2. **Installing a Linux distribution** (such as Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store.
3. **Installing the Windows Terminal app** from the Microsoft Store.

#### Running WSL from the Windows Terminal

Once you have installed WSL and Ubuntu, the easiest way to access the Linux terminal is through the **Windows Terminal** app, which provides a modern, feature-rich terminal experience.

- **Install the Windows Terminal**:
  - Go to the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal) and search for **Windows Terminal**.
  - Click **Install** to add the Terminal app to your system.
  
- **Run WSL from Windows Terminal**:
  - After installation, open **Windows Terminal** (you can search for it in the Start menu).
  - In Windows Terminal, click the down arrow `▼` next to the tab and select **Ubuntu** (or whatever Linux distribution you installed).
  
You’ll now be able to run your Linux environment directly in Windows, using **Bash** in Ubuntu.
