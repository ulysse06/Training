# Remote Development Environment Setup Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a remote development environment, where you will securely connect to a remote host from your local machine. Follow these steps to configure both the host and your local environment.

This tutorial was inspired by [this page of the VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting).

## **0. Introduction to SSH keys**

SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate and securely connect to remote servers or systems. Rather than using a password, SSH keys offer a more secure and convenient way to log into servers.

An SSH key pair consists of two parts:
1. **Private Key**: This stays on your local machine and should be kept secret. It's used to prove your identity when connecting to remote systems.
2. **Public Key**: This can be shared openly. You place this on any server you want to access. The server uses it to verify that the private key you use matches the public key it has.

When you attempt to connect to a server, the server challenges your client to prove it holds the correct private key (without actually sending it). If your client can prove it without revealing the key itself, the connection is successful, and you’re granted access.

**Why use SSH keys?**
- They are more secure than using passwords, especially against brute force attacks.
- They are convenient because you don’t need to type a password every time you log in.
- They can be encrypted with a passphrase for additional security.

Essentially, SSH keys are like a digital ID card that allows you to prove your identity when logging into remote systems.

## **1. Setting Up the Remote Host**

***⚠️ This step is typically done by the host administrator, so you can skip this if you're not the admin.***

To allow your local machine to connect to the remote host, you need to create a new user account on the remote host and set a password for them. 

Before proceeding, ensure the SSH server is installed on the host machine (typically `openssh-server` on Linux). You'll also need to temporarily adjust some SSH configuration settings to allow the key transfer. 

1. **Setup SSH Server**: If not already installed, install and start the SSH server. For example in Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-server # Install OpenSSH Server
    sudo systemctl start ssh        # Start SSH service
    sudo systemctl enable ssh       # (Optionnal) Enable SSH to start on boot
    sudo ufw allow ssh              # (Optionnal) Allow SSH through firewall
    ```

2. **Configure SSH Settings**:
   - Temporarily modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the `PasswordAuthentication` variable to `yes` and the `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` variable to `no`. This step is necessary for the initial key transfer.
   - After completing the key transfer, you should revert these changes to enhance security.

3. **Add a new user and set a password** on the remote host:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -m username
    sudo passwd username
    ```

   Replace `username` with the username you wish to create on the host.

## **2. Test the Connection**

***⚠️ You can start here***

Before proceeding with the SSH key setup, you should verify that your local machine can reach the remote host. Try pinging the host to check the connection:

```bash
ping hostname
```

If the ping fails, check the following:
- Ensure your local machine and the host are on the same network or VPN (if applicable).
- Make sure the host machine is powered on and properly connected to the network.
- Verify the host's firewall settings and ensure that port 22 (SSH) is open.


## **3. Setup your SSH keys**

Now, let's generate an SSH key pair on your local machine. This will allow secure authentication without the need to type a password.

Once the key pair is created, you need to add your public key to the remote host's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to allow passwordless SSH login.

**⚠️ Warning**:

If you're on Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the commands below need to be run in the native PowerShell, **not inside the WSL terminal**!

### **Windows (using PowerShell):**

1. Generate a pair of SSH keys:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096
    ```
    If prompted, accept the default location for the key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) by typing `Enter`.

2. Use `icacls` to grant read permissions to your private key:

    ```bash
    icacls "~/.ssh/id_ed25519" /grant <username>:R
    ```
    Replace `<username>` with your Windows username.

3. Set up the SSH connection by appending the public key to the remote user's `authorized_keys` file:

    ```bash
    $USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
    $PUBKEYPATH="$HOME\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub"
    $pubKey=(Get-Content "$PUBKEYPATH" | Out-String); ssh "$USER_AT_HOST" "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && echo '${pubKey}' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    ```

    Make sure to replace `your-user-name-on-host` with the correct username and `hostname` with the host's address!

### **Linux/MacOS:**

1. Generate a pair of SSH keys:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096
    ```
    When prompted, accept the default location for the key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) by typing `Enter`.

2. Set proper permissions on your private key:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

3. Use `ssh-copy-id` to automatically copy the public key to the remote host's `authorized_keys` file:

    ```bash
    export USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
    export PUBKEYPATH="$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
    ssh-copy-id -i "$PUBKEYPATH" "$USER_AT_HOST"
    ```

    Make sure to replace `your-user-name-on-host` and `hostname` with the appropriate values!

## **4. Check your ssh keys setup**

If you made everything correctly so far, you should be able to connect to the remote host using ssh without being ask to type your password
```
ssh your-user-name-on-host@hostname
```
Remember that you can always close the connexion and return to your local shell using the `exit` command.

## **5. Change your SSH configuration**

To simplify your SSH login process even further, you can configure your SSH settings by adding an entry to the `~/.ssh/config` file on your local machine. This step is optional, but it will make it easier to connect to your remote host in the future.

**⚠️ Warning:**

- If the `~/.ssh/config` file doesn't already exist, you will need to create it manually.

- Windows users should be aware that Windows sometimes masks file extensions by default. This means that a file named `config.txt` might appear as `config` without the `.txt` extension. If you're on Windows, make sure the file is saved without any extension (i.e., just `config`).

In the file `$HOME/.ssh/config`, add the following configuration:

```
Host host-nickname
    HostName hostname
    User your-user-name-on-host
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

- Replace `host-nickname` with a name you choose for your host (e.g., `my-remote-server`).
- Replace `hostname` with the actual hostname or IP address of the remote server.
- Replace `your-user-name-on-host` with the username you created on the host.

Once this configuration is added, you can SSH into the host using the alias you defined. For example:

```bash
ssh host-nickname
```
