# Setting up your dev environment with Git and Conda

*⚠️ This tutorial assumes you’re working in a Linux-based development environment, which could be a native Linux machine, WSL on Windows, or a remote Linux server accessed via SSH.*

When you're diving into development, having the right tools for version control and environment management is essential. Git and Conda are two such tools that have become industry standards, helping you streamline your workflow and ensure your code is well-managed and reproducible across different environments.

## Git

### 0. Introduction

**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track changes to files, and manage different versions of a project over time. Version control helps developers avoid the common issue of losing code or working on outdated versions of a project. Git tracks changes in files, allows you to roll back to previous versions, and lets multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other’s toes.

Git is primarily used in software development, but it can be applied to any kind of project where multiple versions need to be managed over time. It's incredibly popular because it's fast, efficient, and can be used locally without needing an internet connection, unlike some other version control systems.

**What is Version Control?**

Version control is the process of managing changes to documents, code, or other collections of files. A version control system keeps track of every change made to your files, which allows you to:

- **Track changes**: View the history of your project.
- **Collaborate with others**: Work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
- **Revert to previous versions**: Roll back your work if something goes wrong.
- **Branch out and experiment**: Create isolated versions of your project to try out new ideas without affecting the main codebase.

*If you're new to Git, feel free to check out this [other tutorial](https://coderefinery.github.io/research-software-engineering/version-control/) or the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/) for more detailed information.*

### 1. Checking your installation

Since you're on Linux, Git is likely already installed. To check if Git is installed, you can run:

```bash
git --version
```

### 2. Setting up your Git configuration

Even if git is already installed, you still need to configure your global settings. To set up your Git username and email, run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**⚠️ Tip:**

Even when working on private repositories, it's a good habit to use an anonymous email instead of your personal one. You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address) to set this up.

*There are more global setting you can configure, but those two are the mandatory ones.*

## Conda/Mamba - ⚠️Ongoing writting

From now on, all steps can be performed directly within VS Code.

1. **Download and Install Conda or Mamba**  
   Choose one of the following options based on your preference:
   - [Download Mamba Installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest)
   - [Download Miniconda Installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)

2. **Run the Installer**  
   Open your terminal and execute the following command (adjust if you are using Mamba):
   ```
   bash ~/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh  # or the equivalent for Mamba
   ```

3. **Agree to the Terms**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions and agree to all prompts.

4. **Restart Your Terminal**  
   After the installation finishes, restart your terminal to ensure the changes take effect.

5. **Verify Installation**  
   Test your installation by running:
   ```
   conda --version  # or mamba --version if you installed Mamba
   ```
   You should see the version number if it was successful.


## Starting Your Project

1. **Create or Access a GitHub Repository**  
   - If you don’t have a repository, create one for your group.
   - If you're working on an existing repository, access it on GitHub and find the URL (use the green "Code" button).

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Be mindful of where you clone the repository, as it will be downloaded to your current location. Make sure to navigate to the desired directory before running the clone command.

   To clone the repository, including any submodules, use the following command:
   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Set Up Dependencies**  
   Create and activate a dedicated conda environment for the project. Once inside the environment, you can install any required dependencies:
   - If the project provides an `environment.yml` file, run:
     ```
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - If using a `requirements.txt` file, first activate your conda environment and then install the dependencies:
     ```
     conda activate <env-name>
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Start Working!**  
   Once the environment is set up, you can start working on your project directly within VS Code.
