# Git Setup

This tutorial assumes you’re working in a Linux-based development environment, which could be a native Linux machine, WSL on Windows, or a remote Linux server accessed via SSH.

If you're new to Git, check out the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/) for a quick intro.

Since you're on Linux, Git is likely already installed. To check if Git is installed, you can run:

```bash
git --version
```

However, you still need to configure your global settings. To set up your Git username and email, run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Tip:** Even when working on private repositories, it's a good habit to use an anonymous email instead of your personal one. You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address) to set this up.
