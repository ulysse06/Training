## I - Basic navigation and file manipulation

### 1. **`pwd`** - Print Working Directory

Displays the current directory you’re in.

```bash
$ pwd
/home/username
```

### 2. **`cd`** - Change Directory

Used to move between directories.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/directory
$ cd ~   # Go to the home directory
$ cd ..  # Go up one level
```

**[Filesystem Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard):**  
Linux filesystems start from the root directory `/`. All files and directories branch out from this point.  
- The `~` symbol refers to your **home directory**, which is typically `/home/username`.


### 3. **`ls`** - List Directory Contents

Lists files and directories within the current directory.

```bash
$ ls
Documents  Pictures  Downloads
```

**Some usefull flags:**
- `-l`: Displays detailed information (permissions, owner, size, etc.)
  
  ```bash
  $ ls -l
  drwxr-xr-x  2 username username 4096 Jan 28 10:23 Documents
  ```

- `-h`: Human-readable format for file sizes (in KB, MB, GB, etc.) when used with `-l`.
  
  ```bash
  $ ls -lh
  drwxr-xr-x  2 username username 4.0K Jan 28 10:23 Documents
  ```

- `-a`: Shows all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot `.`).
  
  ```bash
  $ ls -a
  .  ..  .bashrc  Documents
  ```

**Role of `.` and `..`:**
- `.` refers to the current directory.
- `..` refers to the parent directory.


### 4. **Relative vs Absolute Paths**

Paths are used to locate files and directories in the filesystem. There are two types of paths you'll commonly work with:

- **Absolute Path**: Full path starting from the root `/`.  
  Example: `/home/username/Documents`
  
- **Relative Path**: Path relative to the current working directory.  
  Example: `Documents` (if you're already in `/home/username`).

### 5. **`mkdir`** - Make Directory

Creates a new directory.

```bash
$ mkdir new_directory
```

### 6. **`touch`** - Create an Empty File

Creates a new empty file (or updates the timestamp of an existing file).

```bash
$ touch newfile.txt
```

### 7. **`rm`** - Remove Files or Directories

Removes files or directories.

```bash
$ rm file.txt
```

**Usefull flags:**
- `-r`: Used to remove directories and their contents recursively.
  
  ```bash
  $ rm -r folder_name
  ```

- `-f`: Forces the removal of files, ignoring nonexistent files and never prompting for confirmation.
  
  ```bash
  $ rm -f file.txt  # Forcefully remove file.txt without asking for confirmation
  ```

**⚠️ Warning:** Be cautious when using `rm -f`, especially combined with the `-r` flag, as it can permanently delete files without any confirmation!

### 8. **`cp`** - Copy Files or Directories

Copies files or directories.

```bash
$ cp source.txt destination.txt
```

**Usefull flag:**
- `-r`: Used to copy directories recursively.
  
  ```bash
  $ cp -r source_folder destination_folder
  ```

### 9. **`mv`** - Move or Rename Files or Directories

Moves or renames files and directories.

```bash
$ mv old_name.txt new_name.txt  # Rename file
$ mv file.txt /path/to/destination/  # Move file
```
**⚠️ Warning:**
Be cautious, as this can lead to ambiguity between renaming and moving files.

### 10. **`cat`** - Concatenate and Display File Contents

Displays the contents of text files.

```bash
$ cat file_1.txt file_2.txt
```

### 11. **`head` & `tail`** - View Beginning or End of a File

- `head` shows the first lines of a file.

  ```bash
  $ head file.txt
  ```
- `tail` shows the last lines of a file.
  ```bash
  $ tail file.txt
  ```
**Usefull flag:**
- `-n`: Used to change the number of lines displayed
  
  ```bash
  $ head -n 5 file.txt
  ```

### 12. Distinction between Text and Binary Files

**Text Files**
- **Definition**: Contain readable characters, typically encoded in ASCII or UTF-8.
- **Common Types**: `.txt`, `.py`, `.html`, `.md`
- **Viewing**: Easily opened with commands like `cat`, `head`, or `tail`.

```bash
$ cat file.txt
Hello, this is a text file!
```

**Binary Files**
- **Definition**: Contain non-readable data, often specific to applications.
- **Common Types**: `.jpg`, `.exe`, `.mp3`, `.zip`
- **Viewing**: Not human-readable; use specialized tools (e.g., image viewers or players).

```bash
$ cat file.jpg  # Will output garbled characters, as it's not a text file
�������... (binary data)
```

### 13. **`file`** - Determine File Type

Determines the type of a file by examining its contents rather than relying on the file extension.

```bash
$ file file.txt
file.txt: ASCII text

$ file file.jpg
file.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
```

### 14. **Interpretation vs. Compilation**

When running programs on Linux, it's important to know whether a language is interpreted or compiled, as it affects how code is executed.

**Interpretation**

- **Definition**: The code is executed line by line by an interpreter. 
- **Examples**: Python, Bash, Ruby.
- **Execution**: Run directly through an interpreter, e.g., `python myscript.py`.
- **Pros**: Easier to test and debug; more flexible.
- **Cons**: Slower execution; requires the interpreter.

**Compilation**

- **Definition**: The code is compiled into machine code by a compiler before execution.
- **Examples**: C, C++, Go.
- **Execution**: First compile with a tool like `gcc`, then run the executable.
- **Pros**: Faster execution; no need for the source code on the system.
- **Cons**: Slower development cycle; platform-specific binaries.

**About file extensions**

File extensions like `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.pdf` are naming conventions that help identify the type of file. However, extensions are not strictly required in Linux, but they are a helpful guideline for both the user and applications.

### 15. **Wildcards**

Wildcards are special characters used in commands for pattern matching.

Examples:

- `*` : Matches any number of characters.
- `?` : Matches a single character.

```bash
$ ls *.txt  # List all .txt files
$ ls file?  # List files named file followed by a single character
```

## II - Additionnal Concepts

### 1. **`echo`** - Print Text to the Screen

Displays text to the terminal, useful for displaying messages, debugging, or working with variables.

```bash
$ echo "Hello, world!"
```

### 2. **Redirecting Output (`>` and `2>`)**

You can redirect the output of a command to a file.

```bash
$ echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
```

- **Standard Output (stdout)** is the normal output of a command.
- **Standard Error (stderr)** is the output for error messages.

To redirect error messages:

```bash
$ ls non_existent_file 2> error.log  # Redirects error to error.log
```

### 3. **Escaping Special Characters**

In Linux, the backslash (`\`) is used as an escape character to allow you to include special characters in strings or commands that would otherwise be interpreted differently.

**Common Escape Sequences:**
- `\n`: Newline (moves to the next line).
- `\t`: Tab (inserts a tab space).
- `\\`: Backslash (to include a literal backslash).
- `\'`: Single quote (useful inside single-quoted strings).
- `\"`: Double quote (useful inside double-quoted strings).

```bash
$ echo "Hello\nWorld"  # Will print "Hello" and "World" on a new line
Hello
World

$ echo "Column1\tColumn2"  # Will print "Column1" and "Column2" with a tab space
Column1    Column2
```

### 4. **Variables**

Variables allow you to store and reuse values. You can create your own variables and use them in commands or scripts.

**Defining and Using Variables:**

```bash
$ name="Alice"  # Define a variable
$ echo $name    # Use the variable
Alice
```

**Note**: When referencing a variable, always use the `$` symbol before the variable name to get its value.

**Environment Variables:**
Some variables are predefined by the system, like `$HOME`, which stores the path to your home directory.

```bash
$ echo $HOME
/home/username
```

**The `$PATH` Variable:**
The `$PATH` variable contains a list of directories that the shell searches for executable files. You can view it with:

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/home/username/bin
```

**Command output storage:**
You can capture the output of a command and store it in a variable. This is useful when you want to use the result of a command later in your script or command line work.

```bash
$ variable=$(command)
```


### 5. **`which`** - Locate a Command

Shows the full path of an executable command.

```bash
$ which ls
/bin/ls
```

### 6. **`chmod`** - Change File Permissions

The `chmod` command is used to modify file permissions. It allows you to control who can read, write, or execute a file.

**Understanding File Permissions:**
Permissions are represented as three sets:
- **Owner** (user)
- **Group**
- **Others**

Each set can have the following permissions:
- **r** (read): Allows reading the file.
- **w** (write): Allows modifying the file.
- **x** (execute): Allows running the file as a program.

**Numeric Mode:**
Permissions can be set using numbers:
- **4** for read (`r`)
- **2** for write (`w`)
- **1** for execute (`x`)

These are combined to set the permissions. For example:
- `7` = `4+2+1` (read, write, execute)
- `6` = `4+2` (read, write)
- `5` = `4+1` (read, execute)

**Example**: Change the permissions to `rwxr-xr--` (owner can read, write, execute; group can read, execute; others can only read):

```bash
$ chmod 754 file.txt
```

**Symbolic Mode:**
You can also use letters to modify permissions:
- **+** adds a permission.
- **-** removes a permission.
- **=** sets exact permissions.

**Examples**:
- Add execute permission for the user:

  ```bash
  $ chmod u+x file.txt
  ```

- Remove write permission for others:

  ```bash
  $ chmod o-w file.txt
  ```

### 7. **Writing and Running Scripts**

You can write a series of commands in a file and execute them as a script. This is useful for automating tasks or creating reusable sets of commands.

**Creating a Script:**

1. Open a text editor (cf. `nano` or `vim`) to write your script.

2. Write your commands in the file, starting with a "shebang" (`#!/bin/bash`) to specify the shell that should run the script. This is important because it tells Linux which *interpreter* to use for the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, this is my script!"
```

3. Save and close the file.

**Making the Script Executable:**

Before you can run a script, you need to change its permissions to make it executable.

```bash
$ chmod u+x myscript.sh
```

This grants execute permissions to the file.

**Running the Script:**

Once the script is executable, you can run it like any other command, using `./` to indicate the current directory.

```bash
$ ./myscript.sh
Hello, this is my script!
```

**Accessing Command-Line Arguments:**

You can pass arguments to your script when you run it, and access them inside the script using special variables.

- `$1`, `$2`, ... represent the first, second, etc. argument passed to the script.
- `$#` represents the number of arguments passed to the script.
- `$@` or `$*` represents all the arguments passed.

Example script that uses command-line arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "The first argument is: $1"
echo "The second argument is: $2"
```

Running the script with arguments:

```bash
$ ./myscript.sh Hello World
The first argument is: Hello
The second argument is: World
```

**Note**: Command-line arguments are very useful for creating more flexible scripts, where users can specify different inputs at runtime.

### 8. **Control structures**

`#TODO`

### 9. **Functions**

`#TODO`

## III - Network Commands

### 1. **`ping`** - Check Network Connectivity

Tests if a system is reachable on the network.

```bash
$ ping example.com
$ ping 1.1.1.1
```

### 2. **`wget` & `curl`** - Download Files from the Internet

- `wget` is used to download files from the web.
  
  ```bash
  $ wget http://example.com/file.txt
  ```

- `curl` is similar, but can be used for more complex HTTP requests.

  ```bash
  $ curl -O http://example.com/file.txt
  ```


### 3. **`ssh`** - Secure Shell

The `ssh` command is used to securely connect to a remote machine over a network. It allows you to run commands and manage files on a remote system as if you were logged in locally.

**Basic Usage:**
To connect to a remote system, use the following syntax:

```bash
$ ssh username@hostname
```

- **username**: The username on the remote system.
- **hostname**: The IP address or domain name of the remote system.

Example:
```bash
$ ssh alice@192.168.1.100
```

You’ll be prompted for the remote user’s password.

**Using SSH Keys for Authentication:**
SSH can also use public-key cryptography for authentication, which is more secure and avoids entering passwords.

**Specifying a Port:**
If the remote system uses a non-default SSH port (default is 22), specify the port with the `-p` flag:

```bash
$ ssh -p 2222 username@hostname
```

### 4. **`scp`** - Secure Copy (over SSH)

Used to copy files between systems over SSH.

```bash
$ scp file.txt username@hostname:/path/to/destination/
```

### 5. **Client vs Server**

In computing, the concepts of client and server are fundamental to understanding how networked systems communicate and interact.

**Client**
- A client is a device, program, or process that requests services or resources from another computer (the server) over a network.
- Some examples:
  - Web browsers requesting web pages
  - Email applications retrieving emails
  - Video game clients connecting to game servers
  - Mobile apps fetching data from remote databases
- Clients are typically user-facing and focus on presenting information and providing user interaction.

**Server**
- A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers (clients) over a network.
- Servers are designed to handle multiple client requests simultaneously and are optimized for reliability, performance, and continuous operation.
- Examples:
  - Web servers (hosting websites)
  - File servers (storing and sharing files)
  - Mail servers (handling email communications)
  - DNS servers (translating domain names to IP addresses)
  - Specialized servers (dedicated to specific applications, such as high performance calculus, game hosting, etc.)

**Client-Server Model**

The interaction between clients and servers follows a standard pattern:
1. The client initiates a request
2. The server receives the request
3. The server processes the request
4. The server sends a response back to the client
5. The client receives and processes the response

**Distributed Networks**

Another network architecture called distributed networks allows nodes to share resources more flexibly, with systems potentially acting as both clients and servers depending on the context.

## IV - Job Control (optional)

As you get more comfortable working in the terminal, you'll often find yourself multitasking by running multiple processes at once. Linux provides several commands to manage these processes, especially when you want to run commands in the background or bring them back to the foreground. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used commands for job control:

### 1. **`top`** - Monitor System Processes

Displays a live view of the processes running on your system, providing information such as CPU and memory usage, associated user, and process IDs (PIDs). 

```bash
$ top   # Display running processes in real time
```

For a more user-friendly, interactive version of `top`, you can use `htop` (if installed).

**Checking GPU Usage:**

If you're working with applications that rely on GPU resources, it's also useful to monitor your graphics card's performance. For NVIDIA GPUs, you can use the `nvidia-smi` command to view detailed information about GPU usage, memory consumption, temperature, and more.

```bash
$ nvidia-smi   # Display NVIDIA GPU statistics
```

This will provide a snapshot of the GPU's current status, including processes using the GPU, memory usage, and other relevant information. Make sure you have the NVIDIA drivers installed to use this command.

### 2. Process ID (PID)

Each running process in Linux is assigned a unique Process ID (PID). This number is used to reference the process for various tasks like terminating or manipulating it.

You can find the PID of a process by using the `ps` command:

```bash
$ ps   # List running processes in the current shell
```

The output will include the PID of each process.

### 3. **`sleep`** and **`wait`**

Both the `sleep` and `wait` commands can be used to manage process timing:

- **`sleep`**: Pauses the execution of a process for a specified duration. This is useful when you want to delay actions or create a pause in your script or terminal session.

    ```bash
    $ sleep 100   # Pauses for 100 seconds
    ```

- **`wait`**: This command waits for a background job to finish. It can be used in scripts or terminal sessions to ensure that background processes complete before continuing.

    ```bash
    $ wait   # Wait for all background jobs to complete
    ```

### 4. Run a Command in the Background

You can run a command in the background by appending `&` to the end of the command. This allows you to continue using the terminal without waiting for the command to finish.

```bash
$ sleep 100 &   # The sleep command will run in the background for 100 seconds
```

### 5. **`jobs`** - List Background Jobs

Shows a list of all background jobs currently running in the terminal session. Displays the job ID, status (running or stopped), and the command that started the job.

```bash
$ jobs
[1] 1234 Running   sleep 100 &
```

### 6. **`fg`** - Bring a Job to the Foreground

Brings a background job back to the foreground (so you can interact with it). You can get the job number using the `jobs` command.

```bash
$ fg %1   # Bring job 1 to the foreground
```

### 7. **`kill`** - Terminate a Job

You can use the `kill` command to terminate a background job or process. You can specify the job number (from `jobs`) or the process ID (PID).

```bash
$ kill %1   # Kill job 1
```

Alternatively, if you know the PID, use:

```bash
$ kill 1234   # Kill process with PID 1234
```


By using these job control commands, you can easily manage multiple processes in the terminal, switching between them and controlling them as needed. This is an essential skill as you begin to multitask more efficiently in a command-line environment.

## V - Other Useful Commands

### 1. **`clear`** - Clear the Terminal Screen

Clears the terminal screen.

```bash
$ clear
```

You can also use the `Ctrl + L` keyboard shortcut to quickly clear the screen in most terminal emulators.

### 2. **`man`** - Manual Pages

Shows the manual or help page for a command.

```bash
$ man ls
```

Press `q` to quit the manual interface.

**Note:** If `man` doesn't provide you with the information you seek, try using `info`.

### 3. **`exit`** - Close the Terminal Session

Exits the current terminal session or closes the terminal window.

```bash
$ exit
```

This command is commonly used to log out of a shell session or close a terminal window. If you are in a nested terminal session, using `exit` will close the current session and return you to the previous one, or it will terminate the window entirely if you're in the primary terminal session.

**Note:** If you are using a terminal inside a graphical interface, closing the terminal window with `exit` will also close the terminal window itself.

### 4. **`uname`** - Display System Information

Shows detailed information about your system's hardware and software.

```bash
$ uname
Linux
```

**Useful flag:**

- `-a`: Displays all available system information, including kernel name, version, machine type, and more.

  ```bash
  $ uname -a
  Linux myhostname 5.4.0-74-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 25 14:00:15 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  ```

**Note:** You can use `uname -r` to only display the kernel version or `uname -m` to show the machine architecture.

### 5. **`date`** - Display or Set the Date and Time

Shows the current date and time.

```bash
$ date
Mon Jan 28 14:35:22 PST 2025
```

**Personnalize output format:**

- `+%Y-%m-%d`: Displays date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

  ```bash
  $ date '+%Y-%m-%d'
  2025-01-28
  ```

- `+%T`: Shows time in `HH:MM:SS` format.

  ```bash
  $ date '+%T'
  14:35:22
  ```

- `-u`: Shows the date and time in UTC.

  ```bash
  $ date -u
  Mon Jan 28 22:35:22 UTC 2025
  ```

### 6. **`du` & `df`** - Disk Usage and Disk Space Information

- **`du`**: Displays the disk usage of files and directories.

  ```bash
  $ du
  4   ./Documents
  8   ./Downloads
  12  .
  ```

- **`df`**: Displays available disk space on mounted filesystems.

  ```bash
  $ df
  Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sda1       10240000   400000  9500000   5% /
  ```

### 7. **`sudo`** - Execute Commands as Superuser

Runs commands with administrative privileges. (Use with caution!)

```bash
$ sudo apt install tree  # Example to install a package
```

**Note:** The root user, or superuser, has unrestricted access to all files and commands on the system. This level of access allows modifications that could potentially affect system stability or security, so it's important to only use `sudo` when necessary and ensure commands are typed correctly.

### 8. **`nano`** - Text Editor

A simple terminal-based text editor.

```bash
$ nano file.txt
```

**Usage:**
- To save a file in `nano`, press `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`.
- To exit `nano`, press `Ctrl + X`. If you haven't saved your changes, it will ask you whether you want to save before exiting.

**Note:**
While `nano` is a beginner-friendly editor, Linux also has more advanced text editors like `vim` (Vi IMproved). `vim` has a steeper learning curve but is incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it.

```bash
$ vim file.txt
```

### 9. **`tmux`** - Terminal Multiplexer

`tmux` is a powerful terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It enables you to split the terminal into multiple panes, switch between different sessions, and detach and reattach to sessions **even after closing the terminal or disconnecting**.

**Basic Usage:**

- Start a new `tmux` session:

  ```bash
  $ tmux
  ```

  This will open a new `tmux` session with a single terminal window.

- List all active `tmux` sessions:

  ```bash
  $ tmux ls
  ```

- Attach to an existing session:

  ```bash
  $ tmux attach -t sessionID
  ```

- Detach from the current session (without closing it):

  Press `Ctrl + b`, then release and press `d`.

  This will detach the session, leaving it running in the background.

**Saving Sessions:**

You can save your `tmux` sessions for later use by detaching and reattaching to them as needed. This allows you to leave processes running even if you disconnect or close your terminal.
